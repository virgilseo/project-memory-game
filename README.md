## Instructions

The cards are shuffled on the grid with the symbol face down.

### Rules

Flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

### Gameplay

* the player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol
* the player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol
* if the cards match, both cards stay flipped over
* if the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down
* the game ends once all cards have been correctly matched
